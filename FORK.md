# Free Code Camp Philly Showcase

## Project Fork Instructions

This workflow is a common way of collaborating on open source projects using Git and GitHub.

We will walk you through how to Fork and Clone the repo so you can begin to contribute.  We will also show you how to Install React dependencies since this project is using React as its' framework. 


## Fork

By forking you are creating a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account.

Here is how to fork:

1. Make sure you’re logged into your GitHub account.

2. Find the GitHub repository with which you’d like to fork.  In this case: https://github.com/tutordelphia/Free-Code-Camp-Philly-Showcase

3. Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand side of the repository’s page (right under your profile picture).

4. Congratulations!  That's it.  Navigate back to your repo listing page and you should see the Free-Code-Camp-Philly-Repo in your repo list.


## Clone

In order to make changes and additions to the code, you must clone it to your local machine.

Here is how to clone:

1. Open GitBash on your local maching and navigate to the folder you would like to save the repo.  (You can do this right in Viusal Studio Code also by clicking "view" on your toolbar and selection "Integrated Terminal").

2. Go to the forked repo in YOUR Git Hub account.  On the right hand side of the page you will see a green button with "Clone or Download".  CLick the green button and copy the url link,

3. Go to GitBash (or VSC if using "integrated termnal") and type: 'git clone" and then paste the url.  Press enter.  

4. Congratulations!  Now you have a working branch on your local machine.

## Install Dependencies

In order to make React work we need to install some dependencies.

1.  Go back to GitBash or VSC.  You should still be root folder directory for the cloned project.  Navigate to the Showcase folder in the directry by typing: 'cd Free-Code-Camp-Philly-Showcase/showcase' 

2. Type 'yarn install'.  This will take a few minutes as yarn builds your dependencies.  

3. When the install is finished, you can type 'yarn start'.  This will run the app and open it in your browser.

4. Congratulations!  Now you can start coding!
