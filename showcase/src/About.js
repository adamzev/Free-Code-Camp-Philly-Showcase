          <li>Showcase our work.</li>
          <li>Learn about development as part of a team.</li>

        <h5>Showcasing our Work</h5>
        <p>
          We have awesome developers in all stages of the learning process (from
          absolute beginner to professional developers) and all of our members
          are producing awesome and interesting work that we feel deserves to be
          shown off.
        </p>
        <h5>Team Development</h5>
        <p>
          As someone just learning to code, one of the hardest things to get
          experience with is how to work with a team. It's intimidating to
          submit your first pull request or to contribute code to someone else's
          project. We aim to provide a friendly place for our members to learn
          those skills by contributing to this site.
